# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Goal

The goal of the analysis is to uncover the target audience for a bike share bussiness.  

### Question: What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

According to the https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/desmoinescityiowa De Moines, IA has a population of 216,853 with a 0.902% growth rate. Even if the number is a lot lower that NY, De Moines is experiencing a constant population growth. With property value under the national average and with a booming job market (ranked #2 best places for bussines by Forbes https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ejmjg/best-places-2-des-moines-iowa/#2e3388265752), millennials are moving here for a more cheaper, layed back lifestyle with lots of outdoor options. 

### Who is the target audience (age)

Analysing the Citi Bike data for the target audience age we can observe that the main audience is born between 1965-1995. With more and more young adults moving to Des Moines a bike bussines will help shape the changing Des Moines. 

### Who is the target audience (user type)

Most rides in NYC Citi data are recuring user, most likely locals that use the bikes to commute to work and get around in the crowded NY streets. With a booming bussiness more people are communting to downtown a bike share bussiness can change the way people are commuting.


### Infrastructure and Legislation

Community leaders are also working on long-term transportation plans for biking and walking. City’s first pilot “protected bike lane” was launched on East Grand Avenue in the East Village. On July 19 the bike lane will get some temporary improvements via a pop-up project led by Team Better Block, a team of city planning experts with the tagline “Reclaiming Cities for the Public Good – One Block at a Time.”


### Conclusion

Des Moines may not have the same population and bike infrastructure as NY City but it's a rapid growing city.
With presure from other cities the comunities and law makers are prioritizing bike infrastructre improvments and inciatives. 
With an already existing scenic trails thougougt the city and an incresing young adult demographice make it the perfect place to start a bike bussiness.
